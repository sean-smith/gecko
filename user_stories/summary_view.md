Summary View

As a logged in user, I want to access a summary of my trips over the past week/month/year so that I may better understand the impact of 
Uber in my life and the environment. When the user is successfully logged in, they will be presented with the home page, (see [home page](home.md)) 
where they will have the option to expand the summary card. Upon expansion, the user will be able to view histograms of money spent, miles 
traveled, or MPG/Person versus time (per day, month, or year.) In addition to the histogram, a pie chart will display the breakdown of Uber
types - X, XL, Pool, etc. - by dollar amounts over a user-selected time period.
