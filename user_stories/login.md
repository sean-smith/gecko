# User Login

When a user opens the appliation, they are presented with a login screen that prompts them to login with Uber. When they click login, they are deeplinked into the uber app where they accept the permissions that we require. Once the user clicks accept, they are deeplinked back to our app and have been successfully logged in.

Should the user not have the Uber app, they will be redirected to a webpage that will have them login to their uber app and accept the permissions.

Should the user fail to complete the login procedure they will be presented with the same login button that they started with.
