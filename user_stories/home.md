# Home Page

As a current user, I want to access the home page so that I may navigate my trips. When the user successfully logs in, or is already logged in, (see login.md) they will be presented with the home page. The home page will summarize their recent activity. The top of the home page will show a "summary view": a bar chart with three different metrics. The first shows money spent, in the user-specified time period, which defaults to one month. The next shows miles travelled in said time period. The final one shows MPG/Person (not including driver). This summary will be presented to the user as the top “card.” When the user scrolls they will see subsequent cards for each trip they took. Each card will have the same format as the summary card but will specify trip date and time, duration, car ridden in, and driver. Should the user not have any trips, they are  displayed a message to take some trips, and perhaps some emojis.
