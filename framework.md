# Our Framework

We are choosing to use Node.js with the Express package as our backend.

We considered using Flask as we are familar with Python but we decided to use Node so that we can learn something new. We've looked online and found copious resources to learn how to use this framework and it seems to be well implemented across industry.

For the database we're going to use a SQL like database as we're storing structured simple data. We considered using MongoDB, however it's better for storing unstructred data. Our use case seems to be better suited towards the structure of SQL. We're looking at databases as a service, Aurora on AWS, or BigTable on Google App engine.

For the frontend we've decided to use Angular 1.x, as there's a lot of documentation on it and it seems simple to implement. We considered Angular 2.x but we didn't like the object oriented nature of type script and there's less documentation on it.
